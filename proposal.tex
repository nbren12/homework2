\maketitle

We are planning on stuyding parallel-in-time algorithms in the context
of a few test problems. The first problem, will be the heat equation,
which is the standard parabolic test problem for these algorithms. In
addition, it will be interesting to see if the parallel-in-time
concept works on energy conserving like Lorenz 63, or weakly
dissipative analogs.

Since we have not yet met to discuss the proposal, we will include
more details at a future date.
